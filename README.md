# THIS DOCUMENT IS REQUIRED

## Using audio visualization, we’ll compare an encrypted and an decrypted file. We’ll visualize an audio file to frequency wavelength and a linear spectrogram. Frequency imperceptible to human ears is noticeable in these graphs. With an encrypted file and its decrypt file, we can manually decode the message by extracting the altered frequencies. If time allows it, we’ll try to encrypt message in the audio files.
